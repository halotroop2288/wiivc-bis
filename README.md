# WiiVC Banner/Icon/Sound (BIS)

This project started as a small request and template sharing thread over gbatemp, it eventually grow into a big project which goal is set a standard for Wii U injection, now it adds practically all injectable console templates.   
This fork is made by Halotroop2288 to include some missing assets to the original repo, as well as some for mods.

## Banner/icon creation guidelines:
* The template is pretty self-explanatory, you will need Rodin NTLG Pro bold and regular fonts.
* Title screens resizing should use bicubic interpolation.

## This repo includes:
* A collection of Wii banners (.bnr)
* A collection of WiiWare banners (.bnr)
* A collection of injected VC banners (GCN, NDS, N64, etc.)
